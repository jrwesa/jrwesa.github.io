## Reference Page

# Cross-Reference


## Link Another Page
There are several ways to link and reference website content within text. Some are easier than others; linking to pages and heading are the easiest methods.

Reference the table *below* for how to common ways to link content and their Markdown syntaxes: 


| Linking | Description & Syntax |
|:---------------|:------------------|
| Link Page | [Link to another page](/docs/layout/subcategory/child-1) with the syntax that follows: `[Link to another page](/)` |
| Link Heading | [Link to another heading](/index#highlight-text) requires the syntax that follows: `[Link to another header](#number--capture-figure)` |
