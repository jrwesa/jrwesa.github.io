## Title
On this page, we made a table of contents with `{:toc}`. The table of contents grabs all headers and places them in a list â€” unless specified. This "Title" section is included in the table of contents. 

However, it can be removed from the table of contents with the `{: .no_toc }` syntax. 

## Title NOT Included in ToC
{: .no_toc }

Look, this section header is not cluded in the table of contents. The above-mentioned sytax was include under the header, like this: 

```
## Title NOT Included in ToC
{: .no_toc }
```
